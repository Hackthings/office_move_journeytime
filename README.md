The objective of this project is to understand how travel time changes for an office move to one or more new London locations and to visualise the output.

A simulated scenario is presented of a move from an office next to St. Pauls to an office in Camden.

2000 staff locations are randomly generated.

The website contains two webapps containing interactive maps.

The [first](http://robinl.github.io/office_move_journeytime/website/) is a map of travel time from each national rail stations outside London to each London location. 

The [second](http://robinl.github.io/office_move_journeytime/website/staff.html) is a map of travel time for each member of staff (as identified by a postcode).

Here are some screengrabs:
